1. Project Title / Headline

📦 Supply Chain Product Performance Dashboard: Revenue, Inventory, and Supplier Insights Across Product Categories

An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to monitor product performance across cosmetics, haircare, and skincare categories. It provides visibility into revenue generation, sales vs. production, order fulfillment efficiency, defect rates, and supplier contributions—empowering supply chain managers to optimize operations, reduce stock risks, and improve supplier collaboration.

2. Short Description / Purpose

The Supply Chain Product Performance Dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of SKU-level performance, supplier contributions, and key operational metrics. It enables business leaders, supply chain managers, and procurement teams to track revenue, production vs. sales gaps, inventory availability, and fulfillment performance across product categories—supporting informed decision-making for demand planning, supplier management, and cost optimization.

3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Main platform for visualization and dashboard design

🔄 Power Query (M) – For data extraction, transformation, and cleaning of SKU and supplier datasets

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For creating dynamic measures such as revenue, stock levels, fulfillment %, and defect rates

🧩 Data Modeling – Structured relationships between product categories, suppliers, and SKU performance metrics

🗄 SQL Server – Used to preprocess transactional and supplier-level data before loading into Power BI

💻 SQL (JOIN, GROUP BY, aggregation functions) – For preparing revenue, inventory, and order datasets

📁 File Format – .pbix (Power BI project) with report exports for presentations

4. Data Source

Source: Product and supply chain dataset (2024).
The dataset includes:

Revenue by product category (Cosmetics, Haircare, Skincare)

Produced vs. Sold units per category

Available stock across product lines

Order fulfillment rate by category

Average defect rates

SKU-level supplier contributions

5. Features / Highlights
• Business Problem

Supply chain leaders face challenges in balancing production, demand fulfillment, and supplier performance across multiple product categories. Gaps between production and sales, inventory bottlenecks, and varying defect rates can directly impact profitability and customer satisfaction.

• Goal of the Dashboard

To provide decision-makers with:

A consolidated view of product revenue and operational KPIs

SKU-level supplier performance tracking

Insights into fulfillment efficiency and defect management

Actionable data for optimizing inventory and procurement strategies

6. Walkthrough of Key Visuals

Top KPIs Panel

Category Cards

Cosmetics: $161,521 revenue, 12,461 units produced, 11,757 sold, 73% fulfillment, 1.92% defect rate.

Haircare: $174,455 revenue, 19,957 produced, 13,611 sold, 88% fulfillment, 2.48% defect rate.

Skincare: $241,628 revenue, 24,366 produced, 20,731 sold, 85% fulfillment, 2.33% defect rate.

Available Stock & Supplier Tables
Breaks down stock by SKU, showing supplier contributions and dependency across categories.

7. Business Impact & Insights

📦 Skincare leads revenue ($241K) but has moderate defect rates—highlighting potential quality improvement needs.

📉 Cosmetics shows lowest fulfillment (73%), signaling risks in meeting demand despite sufficient production.

🤝 Supplier concentration at SKU-level reveals dependencies—critical for mitigating risks in sourcing disruptions.

📊 Balanced category contributions show that revenue is spread across all three categories, reducing reliance on a single product line.

🚀 Actionable Insight: Prioritize boosting cosmetics fulfillment rates and managing haircare defect issues to improve overall supply chain efficiency.)
